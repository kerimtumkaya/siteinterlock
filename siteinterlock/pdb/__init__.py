# `siteinterlock` is a Python package for selecting near-native protein-ligand
# docking poses based upon the hypothesis that interfacial rigidification
# of both the protein and ligand prove to be important characteristics of
# the native binding mode and are sensitive to the spatial coupling of
# interactions and bond-rotational degrees of freedom in the interface.
